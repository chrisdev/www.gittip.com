Installation
============

Thanks for hacking on Gittip! Be sure to review
[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#readme)
as well if that's what you're planning to do.


Dependencies
------------

Building `www.gittip.com` requires [Python
2.7](http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.4/), and a gcc/make toolchain.

All Python library dependencies are bundled in the repo (under `vendor/`) and
if you do not want to install Postgres locally you can try to use a cloud instance
by issuing `make cloud-db` (it is somewhat slow for regular development).

To configure local Postgres create default role and database:

    $ sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser $USER
    $ createdb gittip

On Debian or Ubuntu you will need the following packages:
`libpq5-dev`/`libpq-dev`, (includes headers needed to build the `psycopg2` Python library)
and `python-dev` (includes Python header files for `psycopg2`).

If you are receiving issues from `psycopg2`, please [ensure that its needs are
met](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/faq.html#problems-compiling-and-deploying-psycopg2).

If you are getting an error about `unknown argument: '-mno-fused-madd'` when
running `make`, then add
`Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future` to your
`ARCHFLAGS` environment variable and try again (see [this Stack Overflow answer
for more information](http://stackoverflow.com/a/22355874/347246)):

    $ ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future

Building
--------

All Python dependencies (including virtualenv) are bundled with Gittip in the
vendor/ directory. Gittip is designed so that you don't manage its
virtualenv directly and you don't download its dependencies at build
time.

The included `Makefile` contains several targets. Configuration options
are stored in default_local.env file while overrides are in local.env.

To create virtualenv enviroment with all python dependencies installed
in a sandbox:

    $ make env

If you haven't run Gittip for a while, you can reinstall the dependencies:

    $ make clean env

Add the necessary schemas and insert dummy data into postgres:

    $ make schema
    $ make data


Launching
---------

Once you've installed Python and Postgres and set up a database, you can use
make to build and launch Gittip:

    $ make run

If you don't have make, look at the Makefile to see what steps you need
to perform to build and launch Gittip. The Makefile is pretty simple and
straightforward.

If Gittip launches successfully it will look like this:

```
$ make run
./env/bin/honcho -e default_local.env,local.env run ./env/bin/aspen

Help!
-----

If you get stuck somewhere along the way, you can find help in the #gittip
channel on [Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/) or in the [issue
tracker](/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/new) here on GitHub. If all else fails
ping [@whit537](https://twitter.com/whit537) on Twitter or email
[chad@gittip.com](mailto:chad@gittip.com).

Thanks for installing Gittip! :smiley:


Configuration
=============

Gittip's default configuration lives in [`defaults.env`](https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/blob/master/defaults.env).
If you'd like to override some settings, create a file named `local.env` to store them.

The following explains some of the content of that file:

The `BALANCED_API_SECRET` is a test marketplace. To generate a new secret for
your own testing run this command:

    curl -X POST https://api.balancedpayments.com/v1/api_keys | grep secret

Grab that secret and also create a new marketplace to test against:

    curl -X POST https://api.balancedpayments.com/v1/marketplaces -u <your_secret>:

The site works without this, except for the credit card page. Visit the
[Balanced Documentation](https://www.balancedpayments.com/docs) if you want to
know more about creating marketplaces.

The GITHUB_* keys are for a gittip-dev application in the Gittip organization
on Github. It points back to localhost:8537, which is where Gittip will be
running if you start it locally with `make run`. Similarly with the TWITTER_*
keys, but there they required us to spell it `127.0.0.1`.

If you wish to use different username or database name for the database, you
should change the `DATABASE_URL` using the following format:

    DATABASE_URL=postgres://<username>@localhost/<database name>

Modifying CSS
=============

We use SCSS, with files stored in `scss/`. All of the individual files are
combined in `scss/gittip.scss` which itself is compiled by `libsass` in
`www/assets/%version/gittip.css.spt` on each request.

Testing [![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/gittip/www.gittip.com/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/gittip/www.gittip.com)
=======

Please write unit tests for all new code and all code you change. Gittip's
test suite uses the py.test test runner, which will be installed into the
virtualenv you get by running `make env`. As a rule of thumb, each test case
should perform one assertion.

The easiest way to run the test suite is:

    $ make test

However, the test suite deletes data in all tables in the public schema of the
database configured in your testing environment.

To invoke py.test directly you should use the `honcho` utility that comes
with the install. First `make tests/env`, activate the virtualenv and then:

    [gittip] $ cd tests/
    [gittip] $ honcho -e defaults.env,local.env run py.test

Local Database Setup
--------------------

For the best development experience, you need a local
installation of [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/download/). The best
version of Postgres to use is 9.3.2, because that's what we're using in
production at Heroku. You need at least 9.2, because we depend on being able to
specify a URI to `psql`, and that was added in 9.2.

+ Mac: use Homerew: `brew install postgres`
+ Ubuntu: use Apt: `apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev`

To setup the instance for gittip's needs run:

    $ sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser $USER
    $ createdb gittip
    $ createdb gittip-test

You can speed up the test suite when using a regular HDD by running:

    $ psql -q gittip-test -c 'alter database "gittip-test" set synchronous_commit to off'

### Schema

Once Postgres is set up, run:

    $ make schema

Which populates the database named by `DATABASE_URL` with the schema from `schema.sql`.

The `schema.sql` file should be considered append-only. The idea is that it's the log
of DDL that we've run against the production database. You should never change
commands that have already been run. New DDL will be (manually) run against the
production database as part of deployment.


### Example data

The gittip database created in the last step is empty. To populate it with
some fake data, so that more of the site is functional, run this command:

    $ make data


API
===

The Gittip API is comprised of these six endpoints:

**[/about/charts.json](https://www.gittip.com/about/charts.json)**
([source](https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/tree/master/www/about/charts.json.spt))&mdash;<i>public</i>&mdash;Returns
an array of objects, one per week, showing aggregate numbers over time. The
[charts](https://www.gittip.com/about/charts.html) page uses this.

**[/about/paydays.json](https://www.gittip.com/about/paydays.json)**
([source](https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/tree/master/www/about/paydays.json.spt))&mdash;<i>public</i>&mdash;Returns
an array of objects, one per week, showing aggregate numbers over time. The
[charts](https://www.gittip.com/about/charts.html) page used to use this.

**[/about/stats.json](https://www.gittip.com/about/stats.json)**
([source](https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/tree/master/www/about/stats.spt))&mdash;<i>public</i>&mdash;Returns
an object giving a point-in-time snapshot of Gittip. The
[stats](https://www.gittip.com/about/stats.html) page displays the same info.

**/`%username`/charts.json**
([example](https://www.gittip.com/Gittip/charts.json),
[source](https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/tree/master/www/%25username/charts.json.spt))&mdash;<i>public</i>&mdash;Returns
an array of objects, one per week, showing aggregate numbers over time for the
given user.

**/`%username`/public.json**
([example](https://www.gittip.com/Gittip/public.json),
[source](https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/tree/master/www/%25username/public.json.spt))&mdash;<i>public</i>&mdash;Returns an object with these keys:

  - "receiving"&mdash;an estimate of the amount the given participant will
    receive this week

  - "my_tip"&mdash;logged-in user's tip to the Gittip participant in
    question; possible values are:

      - `undefined` (key not present)&mdash;there is no logged-in user
      - "self"&mdash;logged-in user is the participant in question
      - `null`&mdash;user has never tipped this participant
      - "0.00"&mdash;user used to tip this participant
      - "3.00"&mdash;user tips this participant the given amount
      <br><br>

  - "goal"&mdash;funding goal of the given participant; possible values are:

      - `undefined` (key not present)&mdash;participant is a patron (or has 0 as the goal)
      - `null`&mdash;participant is grateful for gifts, but doesn't have a specific funding goal
      - "100.00"&mdash;participant's goal is to receive the given amount per week
      <br><br>

  - "elsewhere"&mdash;participant's connected accounts elsewhere; returns an object with these keys:

      - "bitbucket"&mdash;participant's Bitbucket account; possible values are:
          - `undefined` (key not present)&mdash;no Bitbucket account connected
          - `https://bitbucket.org/api/1.0/users/%bitbucket_username`
      - "github"&mdash;participant's GitHub account; possible values are:
          - `undefined` (key not present)&mdash;no GitHub account connected
          - `https://api.github.com/users/%github_username`
      - "twitter"&mdash;participant's Twitter account; possible values are:
          - `undefined` (key not present)&mdash;no Twitter account connected
          - `https://api.twitter.com/1.1/users/show.json?id=%twitter_immutable_id&include_entities=1`
      - "openstreetmap"&mdash;participant's OpenStreetMap account; possible values are:
          - `undefined` (key not present)&mdash;no OpenStreetMap account connected
          - `%OPENSTREETMAP_API/user/%openstreetmap_username`


**/`%username`/tips.json**
([source](https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/tree/master/www/%25username/tips.json.spt))&mdash;<i>private</i>&mdash;Responds
to `GET` with an array of objects representing your current tips. `POST` the
same structure back in order to update tips in bulk (be sure to set
`Content-Type` to `application/json` instead of
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`). You can `POST` a partial array to update
a subset of your tips. The response to a `POST` will be only the subset you
updated. If the `amount` is `"error"` then there will also be an `error`
attribute with a one-word error code. If you include an `also_prune` key in the
querystring (not the body!) with a value of `yes`, `true`, or `1`, then any
tips not in the array you `POST` will be zeroed out.

NOTE: The amounts must be encoded as a string (rather than a number).
Additionally, currently, the only supported platform is 'gittip'.

This endpoint requires authentication. Look for your API key on your [profile
page](https://www.gittip.com/about/me.html), and pass it as the basic auth
username. E.g.:

```
curl https://www.gittip.com/foobar/tips.json \
    -u API_KEY: \
    -X POST \
    -d'[{"username":"bazbuz", "platform":"gittip", "amount": "1.00"}]' \
    -H"Content-Type: application/json"
```
